Given the array:
const flowers = [
{ name: "Rose", color: "red", price: 15, availability: 20 },
{ name: "Tulip", color: "yellow", price: 8, availability: 5 },
{ name: "Orchid", color: "purple", price: 25, availability: 10 }
];

First, filter out flowers with a price under $10, then sort the remaining flowers by availability in descending order. Finally, return an array of names in uppercase.

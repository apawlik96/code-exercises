Given the array:
const vacationPackages = [
{ destination: "Maldives", days: 10, cost: 2000 },
{ destination: "Alaska", days: 5, cost: 1000 },
{ destination: "Switzerland", days: 7, cost: 1500 }
];

Find the average daily cost of each package, then filter packages with an average daily cost under $200. Return only the destination names, sorted by cost in ascending order.

Given the array:
const trips = [
{ destination: "Italy", days: 10, rating: 4.8 },
{ destination: "Brazil", days: 5, rating: 4.5 },
{ destination: "Australia", days: 12, rating: 4.9 }
];

Calculate the trip score as days \* rating, filter out trips with a score under 50, and then return an array of destination names sorted by score in descending order.

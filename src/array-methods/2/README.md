Given the object:
const destinations = {
Bali: { region: "Asia", cost: 1200, rating: 4.5 },
Paris: { region: "Europe", cost: 1500, rating: 4.8 },
Tokyo: { region: "Asia", cost: 1300, rating: 4.7 }
};

Convert the object to an array of destinations with region, cost, and rating. Filter out all destinations rated below 4.6, then calculate the average cost of the remaining destinations.

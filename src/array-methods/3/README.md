Given the array:
const flowers = [
{ name: "Daisy", season: "spring", colors: ["white", "yellow"], price: 5 },
{ name: "Sunflower", season: "summer", colors: ["yellow", "orange"], price: 7 },
{ name: "Poinsettia", season: "winter", colors: ["red"], price: 10 }
];

Create an array of all unique colors, then filter only those flowers that contain at least one of these colors. Finally, return an array of objects with name and season properties for those flowers.

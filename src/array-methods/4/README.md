Given the array:
const trips = [
{ location: "Rome", days: 7, cost: 1400 },
{ location: "Sydney", days: 14, cost: 2800 },
{ location: "Maui", days: 10, cost: 2500 }
];

Calculate the total cost per day for each trip, then filter trips costing over $150 per day. Finally, sort these trips by location alphabetically and return an array of their location and days only.

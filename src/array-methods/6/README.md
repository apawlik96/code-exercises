Given the array:
const gardens = [
{ location: "Botanical", area: 500, flowers: ["Rose", "Tulip"] },
{ location: "Community", area: 300, flowers: ["Sunflower", "Daisy"] },
{ location: "City Park", area: 700, flowers: ["Orchid", "Lavender"] }
];

Filter gardens with an area over 400, then map each garden to include the count of flowers it contains. Sort the results by flower count in descending order.

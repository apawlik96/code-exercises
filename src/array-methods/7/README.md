Given the array:
const flowers = [
{ name: "Lily", price: 12, stock: 50 },
{ name: "Violet", price: 8, stock: 30 },
{ name: "Carnation", price: 5, stock: 70 }
];

Find the total revenue potential (price \* stock) of each flower, then filter out those with revenue below $500. Finally, return the names and revenue potential, sorted by revenue potential in ascending order.

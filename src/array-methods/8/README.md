Given the object:
const vacationRatings = {
Maldives: { cost: 2000, rating: 4.9 },
Norway: { cost: 1800, rating: 4.7 },
Canada: { cost: 1600, rating: 4.6 }
};

Convert the object to an array of vacations with cost per point of rating (calculated as cost / rating). Filter out any vacation with a cost per point above 400, then return an array of locations sorted by cost per point in descending order.
